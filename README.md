#Food Survey using HTML and CSS
This project is a simple food survey built using HTML and CSS. The goal of the project is to showcase the author's understanding of HTML and CSS and their ability to create a responsive and visually appealing webpage.

#Getting Started
To get started with this project, you can clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/{username}/{repository_name}.git
Once you have the code on your machine, you can open the index.html file in your web browser to view the survey.

#Usage
The survey consists of a series of questions about food preferences. The questions are presented in a user-friendly format, with radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdown menus used to collect the user's responses.

The survey is designed to be responsive, so it can be viewed on a variety of devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones.

#Customization
If you want to customize the survey, you can modify the HTML and CSS files to suit your needs. You can change the questions, add or remove options, and adjust the styling to match your branding or design preferences.
